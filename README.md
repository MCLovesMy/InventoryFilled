# InventoryFilled
A really small Minecraft Spigot Plugin to tell a player his inventory is full.

I will update this plugin frequently with new stuff. Many things i want to add are listed in the issues section! 
This is my first plugin, so don't hate on my code. I will improve it as much as possible!
